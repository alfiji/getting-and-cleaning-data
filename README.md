# getting-and-cleaning-data

Purpose of Getting and Cleaning Data Project

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work and clean a data set.


 Summary

The following is a summary description of the project instructions:

you should create one R script called run_analysis.R that has the following:

1) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set,
2)  extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement, 
3) uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set,
4) appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names, 
5) creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

You can find additional information about the variables, data and transformations in the codebook.md file.
